	abstract = {An acoustic vortex in an inviscid fluid and its radiation torque on an axisymmetric absorbing object are analyzed beyond the paraxial approximation to clarify an analogy with an optical vortex. The angular momentum flux density tensor from the conservation of angular momentum is used as an efficient description of the transport of angular momentum. Analysis of a monochromatic nonparaxial acoustic vortex beam indicates that the local ratio of the axial (or radial) flux density of axial angular momentum to the axial (or radial) flux density of energy is exactly equal to the ratio of the beam's topological charge l to the acoustic frequency ω. The axial radiation torque exerted by the beam on an axisymmetric object centered on the beam's axis due to the transfer of angular momentum is proportional to the power absorbed by the object with a factor l/ω, which can be understood as a result of phonon absorption from the beam. Depending on the vortex's helicity, the torque is parallel or antiparallel to the beam's axis.},

However, as we will show, there is an additional nonconservative contribution to the scattering force arising in a light field with nonuniform helicity. This force is shown to be proportional to the curl of the spin angular momentum of the light field. The relevance of the spin force is illustrated in the simple case of a {2D} field geometry arising in the intersection region of two standing waves.},

This analysis is consonant with remarks due to von Laue and to works by various authors on the dynamics of spinning particles. In the case of total reflection at a plane interface, one speaks of the longitudinal, or Goos-Hänchen's, and of the transverse, or Imbert's, shifts. These are in a one-to-one association with the observations of the so-called tangential and sagittal focal lines of geometrical optics. When the quanta associated with the waves have nonzero spin, these focal lines possess a fine structure displaying a set of orthogonal-polarization eigenstates. This has been experimentally demonstrated in the total reflection of light beams. Here we extend our previous theory (given for the case of light) by merely interpreting the formulae recently derived by Fradkin and Kashuba for the total reflection of a Dirac electron.},

Although Lorenz-Mie tracking provides more information and is inherently more precise, Rayleigh-Sommerfeld reconstruction is faster and more general. The two techniques agree quantitatively on colloidal spheres’ in-plane positions.

Another line of research has been devoted to the development of generalized {Lorenz–Mie} theories dealing with the interaction between arbitrary electromagnetic shaped beams and some regular particles, allowing one to solve Maxwell’s equations by using a method of separation of variables. Both lines of research are conjointly considered in this paper. Results of generalized {Lorenz–Mie} theories in spherical coordinates (for homogeneous spheres, multilayered spheres, spheres with an eccentrically located spherical inclusion, assemblies of spheres and aggregates) are modified from scalar results in the framework of the Bromwich method to vectorial expressions using vector spherical wave functions ({VSWFs)} in order to match the T-matrix formulation, and to express the T-matrix. The results obtained are used as a basis to clarify statements, some of them erroneous, concerning the T-matrix formulation and to provide recommendations for better terminologies.},

Unlike other collimated beams of light, appropriately designed solenoid beams have the noteworthy property of being able to exert forces on illuminated objects that are directed opposite to the direction of the light’s propagation. We demonstrate this through video microscopy observations of a colloidal sphere moving upstream along a holographically projected optical solenoid beam.},

	abstract = {The acoustic radiation pressure has found practical application in recent years in instruments measuring sound intensity and in experiments on acoustic levitation. The concept of radiation pressure has, however, long fascinated both optical and acoustical physicists. The history of light radiation pressure goes back more than 200 years to Leonhard Euler, while the concept of acoustic radiation pressure dates from the time and work of Rayleigh. It was pointed out by Brillouin that what we call radiation pressure is not a pressure at all, but a diagonal tensor, all the diagonal terms of which are not identical. The size of the effect is small, and the values obtained for the radiation pressure are very sensitive to boundary conditions and to the approximations that must necessarily be employed. In addition, although the phenomenon is primarily one of nonlinear acoustics, it can be observed down to the lowest sound intensities under certain conditions. Thus, the Rayleigh radiation pressure vanishes for the linear case, but the usually measured Langevin pressure does not. It might be said that radiation pressure is a phenomenon that the observer thinks he understands—for short intervals, and only every now and then.},

Recent theoretical studies have shown that small particles can be pulled by light beams against the photon stream, even in beams with uniform optical intensity along the propagation axis. Here, we present a geometry to generate such a ‘tractor beam’, and experimentally demonstrate its functionality using spherical microparticles of various sizes, as well as its enhancement with optically self-arranged structures of microparticles. In addition to the pulling of the particles, we also demonstrate that their two-dimensional motion and one-dimensional sorting may be controlled conveniently by rotation of the polarization of the linearly polarized incident beam. The relative simplicity of this geometry could serve to encourage its widespread application, and ongoing investigations will broaden the understanding of the light–matter interaction through studies combining more interacting micro-objects with various properties.},

Optical tweezers, including the recently developed dynamic multiple-beam optical tweezers, have been shown to be indispensable tools in several fields. We demonstrate an optical trap that is formed by four laser beams. In our Differential Active Optical Manipulator ({DAOM)} the beams are arranged along the axes of a tetrahedron and are approximately collimated within the vicinity of their point of intersection. The {DAOM} makes use of a distinctive advantage of
collimated light: in contrast to optical tweezers, this instrument allows movement of the confined particle over long distances without mechanical scanning. The beams' scattering forces superimpose in their common volume, and the total force (magnitude and direction) on the particle can be set by adjusting the beams' intensities. This can be done quickly and independently for each
beam, allowing us to move a particle along arbitrary paths within a volume of about 1nl. Active feedback ensures that the sample can be held in place or transported to a specified position
as desired. This allows focusing and lateral translation of the microscopic sample, which are common tasks in microscopy. During manipulation the particle is simultaneously observed from four sides. This opens new perspectives for {3D} microscopy combined with contactless manipulation of the sample under observation.},

Zhao et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 073901 (2007)] was treated as evidence for the spin-to orbital angular momentum conversion.

It is shown that the representation has a simple physical interpretation in terms of a modified Huygens-Fresnel principle which operates with secondary plane waves rather than with secondary spherical waves.},

We show that both ‘spin’ and ‘orbital’ angular momentum are observables. However, the transversality of the radiation field affects the commutation relations for the associated quantum operators. This implies that neither S nor L are angular momentum operators. Moreover their eigenvalues are not discrete. We construct field modes such that each mode excitation (photon) is in a simultaneous eigenstate of S z and L z. We consider the interaction of such a photon with an atom and the resulting effect on the internal and external part of the atomic angular momentum.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.3514},
	abstract = {We analyze numerically the correspondence between the mechanical action, experienced by a spherical microparticle, and the internal energy flows as well as spatial and polarization inhomogeneity of the light field incident on the particle. The inhomogeneous incident field is modelled by superposition of two plane waves, the mechanical action is calculated via the Mie theory for dielectric and conducting particles of different sizes and optical properties. It is shown that both spin and orbital components of the field momentum can produce the mechanical action, which can thus be used for experimental study of the internal energy flows in light beams. However, exact value and even direction of the force applied to a particle depends on many details of the field-particle interaction. Besides, forces that are not associated with any sort of the energy flow (we attribute them to the gradient force owing to the inhomogeneous intensity and to the dipole force emerging due to inhomogeneous polarization) can strongly modify the observed mechanical action. The results should be taken into account in experiments employing the motion of probing particles suspended within optical fields. We suppose that situations where an optical field exerts the polarization-dependent mechanical action on particles can be treated as a new form of the spin-orbit interaction of light.},

In the absence of an intensity gradient, using a light beam to pull a particle backwards is counter-intuitive. Here, we show that it is possible to realize a backward scattering force that pulls a particle all the way towards the source without an equilibrium point. The underlining physics is the maximization of forward scattering via interference of the radiation multipoles. We show explicitly that the necessary condition to realize a negative (pulling) optical force is the simultaneous excitation of multipoles in the particle, and if the projection of the total photon momentum along the propagation direction is small, an attractive optical force is possible. This possibility adds ‘pulling’ as an additional degree of freedom to optical micromanipulation.},

To characterize hydrophobicity of the micro-particle, slip length in Navier’s formula is used as an index. Analytical expressions are derived and a parametric analysis for photophoretic velocity is performed with emphasis on the influences of particle characteristics such as size, optical properties, hydrophobicity, and thermal conductivity. Heat source function and the corresponding asymmetry factor at various conditions are evaluated to interpret the mechanisms of negative and positive photophoresis and the conditions for transition between them. The present theory discloses that the particle surface hydrophobicity or fluid slippage at particle-liquid interface may lead to a remarkable enhancement in the particle photophoretic velocity in liquids. Higher particle thermal conductivity and larger size of liquid molecules both result in weaker photophoretic motion.},

	abstract = {An expression is derived for the radiation force on a sphere placed on the axis of an ideal acoustic Bessel beam propagating in an inviscid fluid. The expression uses the partial-wave coefficients found in the analysis of the scattering when the sphere is placed in a plane wave traveling in the same external fluid. The Bessel beam is characterized by the cone angle β of its plane wave components where β = 0 gives the limiting case of an ordinary plane wave. Examples are found for fluid spheres where the radiation force reverses in direction so the force is opposite the direction of the beam propagation. Negative axial forces are found to be correlated with conditions giving reduced backscattering by the beam. This condition may also be helpful in the design of acoustic tweezers for biophysical applications. Other potential applications include the manipulation of objects in microgravity. Islands in the (ka,β) parameter plane having a negative radiation force are calculated for the case of a hexane drop in water. Here k is the wave number and a is the drop radius. Low frequency approximations to the radiation force are noted for rigid, fluid, and elastic solid spheres in an inviscid fluid.},

By introducing a fluidic flow, the assembled particles were separated into two different downstream positions according to their sizes by the negative photophoretic force and the dragging force acted on the particles. The intensity distribution of light leaked from the fiber and the asymmetry factor of energy distribution have been analysed as crucial factors in this separation. Poly(methyl methacrylate) particles (5-/10-μm diameter), {SiO2} particles (2.08-/5.65-μm diameter), and {SiO2} particles (2.08-μm diameter) mixed with yeast cells were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the separation.

	abstract = {In this article, we propose a method for three-dimensional optical trapping of metallic Mie particles using an obstructed laser beam. It is found from the ray-optics model that Mie gold,silver, and copper particles can be trapped against gravity in the focal region of a high numerical-aperture objective illuminated by a centrally obstructed Gaussian ( {TEM} 00 -mode) beam. The axial trapping force of the three types of metallic particles is maximized in the near-infrared wavelength region. The maximum axial trapping efficiency increases with the size of the center obstruction and the aperture angle of an objective. Axial trapping force on Mie metallic particles is enhanced by a factor of two if an obstructed doughnut ( {TEM} 01 * -mode) beam is employed. The experimental condition for achieving three-dimensional trapping is also discussed.},

With the help of model examples, the results are applied to investigation of {TEF} singularities in connection with the usual polarization morphology characteristics of paraxial optical fields. An analysis of {TEFs} near singular points has been carried out; in particular, the behavior of {TEF} and its partial contributions near polarization singularities (C-points) has demonstrated the special role of a boundary flow in the origin of the spin angular momentum.

We propose a two-beam interference technique that results in an appreciable level of spin flow in moderately focused beams and detection of the orbital motion of probe particles within a field where the transverse energy circulation is associated exclusively with the spin flow.

	abstract = {Abstract We investigate the separation of the total angular momentum J of the electromagnetic field into a ‘spin’ part S and an ‘orbital’ part L. We show that both ‘spin’ and ‘orbital’ angular momentum are observables. However, the transversality of the radiation field affects the commutation relations for the associated quantum operators. This implies that neither S nor L are angular momentum operators. Moreover their eigenvalues are not discrete. We construct field modes such that each mode excitation (photon) is in a simultaneous eigenstate of S z and L z. We consider the interaction of such a photon with an atom and the resulting effect on the internal and external part of the atomic angular momentum.},

	abstract = {We measure, in a single experiment, both the radiation pressure and the torque due to a wide variety of propagating acoustic vortex beams. The results validate, for the first time directly, the theoretically predicted ratio of the orbital angular momentum to linear momentum in a propagating beam. We experimentally determine this ratio using simultaneous measurements of both the levitation force and the torque on an acoustic absorber exerted by a broad range of helical ultrasonic beams produced by a 1000-element matrix transducer array. In general, beams with helical phase fronts have been shown to contain orbital angular momentum as the result of the azimuthal component of the Poynting vector around the propagation axis. Theory predicts that for both optical and acoustic helical beams the ratio of the angular momentum current of the beam to the power should be given by the ratio of the beam’s topological charge to its angular frequency. This direct experimental observation that the ratio of the torque to power does convincingly match the expected value (given by the topological charge to angular frequency ratio of the beam) is a fundamental result.},

Phase diagrams with respect to the material parameters are presented, which exhibit the possibility of the appearance of {NLOF.} From dynamical simulations of the particle performed both in the transverse plane and along the longitudinal direction, an even clearer picture of the realization of stable {NLOF} is presented. It is shown that, due to rotation induced by the orbital angular-momentum of light, higher order Bessel beams cannot stably confine a particle to the beam center where {NLOF} occurs in the absence of ambient damping, which largely limits their applications for long-distance, stable, backward particle transportation. On the other hand, zero-order Bessel beams can achieve stable transverse confinement of the manipulated particle and act as an optical tractor beam per se. In addition, for a nonmagnetic particle with relative permeability μ=1, a Bessel beam with transverse electric polarization is more favorable for the realization of {NLOF} than a transverse magnetic beam. Finally, a brief discussion is also presented of the conditions under which an off-beam-axis particle could be suitable for backward transportation using {NLOF.}},

However, it cannot be called a “tractor beam” per se, as long as the light pulling effect is ultrasensitive to the object’s material and size, a perturbation of which will make the optical traction go away. In this Letter, we investigate and report on the universality for a Bessel beam to be either a material-independent or size-independent optical tractor beam within the dipolar regime. Moreover, a general condition for a nonparaxial laser to be simultaneously a material- and size-independent tractor beam is proposed. These universal pulling effects and conditions are discussed in association with insight on modified far-field scattering, scattering resonances, and induced polarizabilities. Interestingly, we find that the acoustic pulling force exhibits only size independence, owing to the acoustic scattering theory in contrast to the light scattering counterpart. The findings pave the way for the realistic engineering and application of universal tractor beams pulling a wide variety of objects.},

For the most of the created vector fields, the spatial distribution in states of polarization ({SoPs)} is dependent of azimuthal angle only. It is very interesting and crucial that if we can introduce the radial controlling freedom, which undoubtedly opens a new way to provide the flexibility for creating the desired vector fields and for fulfilling the requirement on a variety of applications. Here we present a new idea to create a new kind of vector filed with the radial-variant {SoPs.} This idea also permits to create flexibly vector fields with arbitrarily complex distribution of {SoPs}, based on a combination of radial and azimuthal dependency. This realization in both principle and experiment is paramount to be able to implement the focusing engineering for applications in a variety of realms. Specially arranging the {SoPs} of vector fields, purposefully and carefully, is anticipated to lead to new effects and phenomena that can expand the functionality and enhance the capability of optical systems, such as the optical trapping.},

With a laser beam of 1.55 µm (170 {mW)} injected into the fiber, particles moved towards the position, which is about 380 µm away from the tip of the fiber, and assembled at a 290 µm × 100 µm spindle-shaped region. The highest assembly speed of particles is 22.1 ind./s and the highest moving velocity is 20.5 µm/s, which were induced by both negative photophoresis and temperature gradient. The number of assembled particles can reach 10,150 in 15 minutes. With a move of the fiber, the assembled particles will also migrate. We found that, when the fiber was moved 172 µm away from its original location, almost all of the assembled 10,150 particles were migrated to a new location in 140 s with a distance of 172 µm from their original location.},

A parametric study of the transverse trapping forces was made as a function of bead radius and laser power for two objective lenses having numerical apertures of 0.65 (40×) and 1.25 (100×). Measured forces were compared with numerical estimates based on generalized {Lorenz–Mie} theory reported in literature. Optical tweezers were also characterized in terms of the optical potential well by measuring the displacement of trapped particles experiencing a viscous drag at a fluid flow below the critical velocity. Following this procedure, trap stiffness was determined for several bead radii and at different numerical apertures of the objective lenses.},

	abstract = {We calculate the forces of single-beam gradient radiation pressure laser traps, also called “optical tweezers,” on micron-sized dielectric spheres in the ray optics regime. This serves as a simple model system for describing laser trapping and manipulation of living cells and organelles within cells. The gradient and scattering forces are defined for beams of complex shape in the ray-optics limit. Forces are calculated over the entire cross-section of the sphere using {TEM00} and {TEM01*} mode input intensity profiles and spheres of varying index of refraction. Strong uniform traps are possible with force variations less than a factor of 2 over the sphere cross-section. For a laser power of 10 {mW} and a relative index of refraction of 1.2 we compute trapping forces as high as ∼ 1.2 × 10-6 dynes in the weakest (backward) direction of the gradient trap. It is shown that good trapping requires high convergence beams from a high numerical aperture objective. A comparison is given of traps made using bright field or differential interference contrast optics and phase contrast optics.},

The electromagnetic field is expanded as a set of vector spherical wavefunctions ({VSWFs)} that describe the field over all space. Given the incident field, the resultant force on a given Rayleigh particle can be calculated throughout a volume of interest. We use an evolutionary algorithm ({EA)} to search the space of coefficients governing the {VSWFs} for those that produce the desired force field. We demonstrate how Maxwell’s equations will support an “optical tunnel” that guides particles to a trap location while at the same time preventing particles outside the tunnel from approaching the trap. This result is of interest because the field is impressed throughout the domain; that is to say, once the field is generated, no additional control is required to guide the particles.},

By starting from Maxwell's equations, and scaling transverse and longitudinal distances by the beam waist w0 and diffraction length l, respectively, an expansion procedure in powers of w0/l is developed. The exact equations obeyed by the zeroth-order fields are not Maxwell's equations but the customary paraxial approximation to Maxwell's equations. Equations for the first-, second-, and third-order fields are developed. The first-order field is found to be a longitudinal field. It is solved for explicitly in terms of the zeroth-order field which is transverse. Thus a precise knowledge of the meaning and accuracy of paraxial wave optics is obtained.},

	abstract = {An investigation is made of the structure of the electromagnetic field near the focus of an aplanatic system which images a point source. First the case of a linearly polarized incident field is examined and expressions are derived for the electric and magnetic vectors in the image space. Some general consequences of the formulae are then discussed. In particular the symmetry properties of the field with respect to the focal plane are noted and the state of polarization of the image region is investigated. The distribution of the time-averaged electric and magnetic energy densities and of the energy flow (Poynting vector) in the focal plane is studied in detail, and the results are illustrated by diagrams and in a tabulated form based on data obtained by extensive calculations on an electronic computor. The case of an unpolarized field is also investigated. The solution is not restricted to systems of low aperture, and the computational results cover, in fact, selected values of the angular semi-aperture \${\textbackslash}alpha \$ on the image side, in the whole range 0 \${\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}leq \$ 90 degrees. The limiting case \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}rightarrow \$ 0 is examined in detail and it is shown that the field is then completely characterized by a single, generally complex, scalar function, which turns out to be identical with that of the classical scalar theory of Airy, Lommel and Struve. The results have an immediate bearing on the resolving power of image forming systems; they also help our understanding of the significance of the scalar diffraction theory, which is customarily employed, without a proper justification, in the analysis of images in low-aperture systems.},

	abstract = {A method for calculating the extinction, absorption, and scattering cross sections of clusters of neighboring spheres for both fixed and random orientations is developed. The analysis employs the superposition formulation for radiative interactions among spheres, in which the total field from the cluster is expressed as a superposition of vector spherical harmonic expansions about each of the spheres in the cluster. Through the use of addition theorems a matrix equation for the expansion coefficients is obtained. Further application of addition theorems on the inverse of the coefficient matrix is shown to yield analytical expressions for the orientation-averaged total cross sections of the sphere cluster. Calculations of the cross sections of pairs of spheres and fractal aggregates of several spheres are presented. It is found that a dipole representation of the field in each sphere does not adequately predict the absorption cross section of clusters of small-size-parameter spheres when the spheres are highly conducting. For this situation several multipole orders are required for an accurate calculation of the absorption cross section. In addition, the predicted absorption of sphere clusters can be significantly greater than that estimated from the sum of the isolated-sphere cross sections.},

The equilibrium position and trap stiffness oscillate as functions of the circumference–to–wavelength ratio, a signature of interference, not predicted by previous theories. We also present comparisons with experimental results.},

From the experiments, the axial and transverse stiffness values are 1.2 times larger and 0.8 times smaller, respectively, with radial polarization.

We show that the most basic form of cross-situational learning—whereby information from multiple episodes is combined to eliminate incorrect meanings—can perform badly when words are learned independently and meanings are drawn from a nonuniform distribution. If learners further assume that no two words share a common meaning, we find a phase transition between a maximally efficient learning regime, where the learning time is reduced to the shortest it can possibly be, and a partially efficient regime where incorrect candidate meanings for words persist at late times. We obtain exact results for the word-learning process through an equivalence to a statistical mechanical problem of enumerating loops in the space of word-meaning mappings.},

	abstract = {The cross sections associated with absorption, scattering, extinction, and radiation pressure for homogenous isotropic spheres illuminated by plane waves are well known. We derive a new fundamental cross section, namely, the one which gives the time-averaged torque caused by circularly-polarized illumination. Consider a z-directed wave with pure circular polarization corresponding to a positive value for the z projection of the photon spin. Formulation of the Maxwell stress dyad of the total (incident + scattered) field gives the following torque relative to the sphere's center, {Γz=ILπα2Qabs/ω.} Here {IL} and ω are the incident wave's irradiance and angular frequency and α and Qabs are the sphere's radius and Mie-theoretic absorption efficiency. Consequently the effective cross section for torque is the same as that for energy absorption {πα2Qabs} as might be expected since the scattered radiation is shown to have the same ratio of z component of angular momentum to energy as the incident wave. This result is rigorous for stationary isotropic spheres in vacuo. It may be used to estimate the steady-state angular velocity ωsz of a sphere in a gas which is achieved when Γz is balanced by the viscous-drag torque. A Rayleigh-scattering approximation for Qabs, which should be useful for small spheres, gives {ωsz≃ILMgM′M′′/ηc(M′2+2)} where the sphere's refractive index is {M′+iM′′} relative to that of the gas Mg, η is the viscosity of the gas, and c is the speed of light. The radiation torque caused by elliptically-polarized illumination and the torque on stratified spheres are also discussed.},

Furthermore, we realized a novel optical mixer created by particles spiraling in counter-propagating interfering optical vortices and a new tool for optical tomography or localized spectroscopy enabling sterile contactless rotation and reorientation of a trapped living cell.

This method has been extended to the computation of optical forces. In this article we further extend the coupled dipole method to the computation of optical torque. First, we establish the equation to obtain the optical torque using the coupled dipole method, stressing the importance of the radiative reaction term. Second, we compare our theory to existing models for validation. Third, we apply our method to the computation of optical torque, from a plane wave circularly polarized on a micropropeller. The influence of geometry and relative permittivity on the optical torque is studied.},

Heat capacity is well understood in gases and solids but not in the third main state of matter, liquids, and is not discussed in physics textbooks as a result. The perceived difficulty is that interactions in a liquid are both strong and system-specific, implying that the energy strongly depends on the liquid type and that, therefore, liquid energy can not be calculated in general form. Here, we develop a phonon theory of liquids where this problem is avoided. The theory covers both classical and quantum regimes. We demonstrate good agreement of calculated and experimental heat capacity of 21 liquids, including noble, metallic, molecular and hydrogen-bonded network liquids in a wide range of temperature and pressure.},

Optical pulling can be realized, e.g., using a diffraction-free Bessel beam, and is expected to be of great importance in manipulation of microscopic droplets in micro- and nanofluidics. Compared to conventional optical pushing, however, the ratio of optical net force to stress acting on a droplet is much smaller, increasing the importance of oscillations. We describe the time-dependent surface deformations of a water microdroplet under optical pulling to linear order in the deformation. Shape oscillations have a lifetime in the order of microseconds for droplet radii of a few micrometers. The force density acting on the initially spherical droplet is strongly peaked near the poles on the beam axis, causing the deformations to take the form of jet-like protrusions.},

	abstract = {A method for calculating the extinction, absorption, and scattering cross sections of clusters of neighboring spheres for both fixed and random orientations is developed. The analysis employs the superposition formulation for radiative interactions among spheres, in which the total field from the cluster is expressed as a superposition of vector spherical harmonic expansions about each of the spheres in the cluster. Through the use of addition theorems a matrix equation for the expansion coefficients is obtained. Further application of addition theorems on the inverse of the coefficient matrix is shown to yield analytical expressions for the orientation-averaged total cross sections of the sphere cluster. Calculations of the cross sections of pairs of spheres and fractal aggregates of several spheres are presented. It is found that a dipole representation of the field in each sphere does not adequately predict the absorption cross section of clusters of small-size-parameter spheres when the spheres are highly conducting. For this situation several multipole orders are required for an accurate calculation of the absorption cross section. In addition, the predicted absorption of sphere clusters can be significantly greater than that estimated from the sum of the isolated-sphere cross sections.},

with both electric and magnetic response, immersed in an arbitrary
non-absorbing medium, due to a generic incident electromagnetic field.
Expressions for the gradient force, radiation pressure and curl components
are obtained for the force due to both the electric and magnetic dipoles
excited in the particle. In particular, for the magnetic force we tentatively
introduce the concept of curl of the spin angular momentum density of
the magnetic field, also expressed in terms of {3D} generalizations of the
Stokes parameters. From the formal analogy between the conservation of
momentum and the optical theorem, we discuss the origin and significance
of the self-interaction force between both dipoles; this is done in connection with that of the angular distribution of scattered light and of the extinction cross section.},

In this paper we demonstrate how the spatial spectrum phase modulation of such Bessel beam can be used for its precise three-dimensional position control or even splitting it in several parallel Bessel beams. Applying these features to a simple computer-driven interactive setup enabled us to guide selected particles between remote planes demonstrating the possibility of active sorting of micro-objects. In the case of two axially shifted co-axial Bessel beams a system of counter-propagating Bessel beams can be obtained using a mirror. The interference of such counter-propagating beams provide a standing-wave axial modulation of the field intensity. The position of this standing wave peaks can be controlled altering phase of one of the beams leading to the concept of an {'Optical} conveyor belt' for transport of micro-objects. However, using a time-sharing between the two beams causes that the interference is suppressed, but their correct axial overlap assures a stable position for object confinement. This geometry can be used then for real-time interactive three-dimensional position control of several objects. Such light fields have broader applications, for example in two-photon processes in biophysics such as photoporation of living cells providing transport of modified {DNA} from surrounding medium inside the cell volume and consequent synthesis of fluorescent protein.},

The circulatory bias in the particle’s thermally driven trajectory is not simply a deterministic response to the solenoidal component of the force but rather reflects interplay between advection and diffusion in which thermal fluctuations extract work from the nonconservative force field. As an example of this previously unrecognized class of stochastic heat engines, we consider a colloidal sphere diffusing in a conventional optical tweezer. We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that nonconservative optical forces bias the particle’s fluctuations into toroidal vortexes whose circulation can reverse direction with temperature or laser power.},

We show that helicity is distinct from Lipkin's 00-zilch; a simple relationship exists between the two only for monochromatic fields. It is only the optical helicity that has the correct dimensions of an angular momentum, thereby accurately describing the helicity of light.

The expression uses the partial-wave coefficients found in the analysis of the scattering when the sphere is placed in a plane wave traveling in the same external fluid. The Bessel beam is characterized by the cone angle β of its plane wave components where β = 0 gives the limiting case of an ordinary plane wave. Examples are found for fluid spheres where the radiation force reverses in direction so the force is opposite the direction of the beam propagation. Negative axial forces are found to be correlated with conditions giving reduced backscattering by the beam. This condition may also be helpful in the design of acoustic tweezers for biophysical applications. Other potential applications include the manipulation of objects in microgravity. Islands in the (ka,β) parameter plane having a negative radiation force are calculated for the case of a hexane drop in water. Here k is the wave number and a is the drop radius.

	abstract = {The nonequilibrium distribution of colloids in a polymer solution under a temperature gradient is studied experimentally. A slight increase of local temperature by a focused laser drives the colloids towards the hot region, resulting in the trapping of the colloids irrespective of their own thermophoretic properties. An amplification of the trapped colloid density with the polymer concentration is measured, and is quantitatively explained by hydrodynamic theory. The origin of the attraction is a migration of colloids driven by a nonuniform polymer distribution sustained by the polymer’s thermophoresis. These results show how to control the thermophoretic properties of colloids.},

	abstract = {The generalized phase contrast ({GPC)} method has been applied to transform a single {TEM00} beam into a manifold of counterpropagating-beam traps capable of real-time interactive manipulation of multiple microparticles in three dimensions ({3D).} This paper reports on the use of low numerical aperture ({NA)}, non-immersion, objective lenses in an implementation of the {GPC-based} {3D} trapping system. Contrary to high-{NA} based optical tweezers, the {GPC} trapping system demonstrated here operates with long working distance ({\textgreater}10 mm), and offers a wider manipulation region and a larger field of view for imaging through each of the two opposing objective lenses. As a consequence of the large working distance, simultaneous monitoring of the trapped particles in a second orthogonal observation plane is demonstrated.},
